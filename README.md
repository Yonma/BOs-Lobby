## ‚ùìFAQ

### How can I reset a dimension ?

Just delete the dimension and the basic structures will be automatically regenerated after the server restart.

Relevant folders:

- `dimensions/lobby/fishing_dimension`
- `dimensions/lobby/gaming_dimension`
- `dimensions/lobby/lobby_dimension`
- `dimensions/lobby/mining_dimension`
- `dimensions/lobby/void_dimension`

### How can I reset the default bases like the mining base, fishing base or the spawn without resetting the dimension ?

Teleport to the corresponding dimension and run the corresponding functions like:

- `/function lobby:fishing_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:gaming_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:lobby_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:mining_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:void_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:newdim_dimension_load`

**Note: This will overwrite any existing block, but no entities see <https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-102430>.**

### How can I remove all entities from the mining dimension from other Mods ?

Just use the following admin command: `/execute in lobby:mining_dimension run kill @e[type=!player,distance=0..]`

### The users are not instantly transferred to the lobby dimension on their first join. Any way to fix this ?

Unfortunately to avoid any side effects with other mods, the user needs first to join the overworld so that all mods are able to sync their data.
As soon these data are synced the user could be transferred to the lobby dimension without any issues.
The transfer could be disabled in the related config file.

### Will there are 1.16.5 version ?

There are already a lot of dimension mods for 1.16.5 which are covering similar functionality like:

- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-mining-dimension>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools-dimensions>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aroma1997s-dimensional-world>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensionaldoors>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunting-dimension>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-team-islands-forge>

I see not really any reason why there should be "another" dimension mod for 1.16.5, which only provides the basic functionality.

### I get the message "Worlds using Experimental Settings are not supported"?

This message is expected for all "custom" dimension, because the mod is using separate custom dimensions you will see this message with this mod.
The message could be disabled with mods like [Shutup Experimental Settings!][shutup-experimental-settings].

### I installed the mod, but it is not working?

There are some mods which blocking the custom dimension creation until they have created their custom dimensions.
If this happens other mods are not able to create their customer dimension on the first start.
Normally the issue is fixed by just restarting the server, you will additionally see a message in the log if this is needed.

### Will there are fabric version ?

Unfortunately I have no time to work on a separate fabric version.

### How to remove the mod and restore my former world ?

The mod adds the new dimension over data-packs, as soon you remove the mod, these data-packs are missing and Minecraft is unable to create the additional dimensions.

**The easiest way would be to restore the recommend backup you created before installing or updating the mod.**
